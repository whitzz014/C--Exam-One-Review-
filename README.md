## Nick Uploaded Review Slide in Week 6 Folder 
    - he trimmed down slides to most imporntant 

## Below are things from Nicks Solution Files 

## Assignment 1 - Student Info
    - to access ReadKey() use var name.Key 
    - Review composite formatting to output array instead of stirng interpolation 

## Assignment 2 - Number Guessing Game
    - Review TryParse
    - Parse is ok but need to use try catch block to handle an error 
    - continue; skips the rest of code block left in while loop 
    - if you use an infinite while loop make sure to have a break statement somewhere 

## Assignment 3 - BitWise Operator 
    - classes are player, game, displayBoard, play
    - uses Game class in main method so if he wants to run it infinite he only needs to use one line of code in a while loop 
    - switch statement can use fall through 
    - No multiple classes in single file => new class = new file 

## Assignment 4 - Customer tracker 
    - Extension Methods are on the test
        - Review and practice them
    - classes customer, person, perferredCustomer 
    - Assignemnt focuses on inheritance 
    - need to use a backing field if you need to customize a getter or setter 
    - could put perferredCustomers in Customers[] because of polymorphism (same type (sub types of Person class))
    - Focus on this Assingment 
        - Array of derived object types 
        - classes and sub classes 
    - Using multiple class types on the Test 

## Assignment 5 - War Card Game 
 
    - class deck, card, player, game, suit (enum), Round 
    - operator overloading and enums on the test
